## Security

### As a Service, I should: 

- Follow the [security guidelines for developers](https://github.com/jcavell/security-guide-for-developers/wiki)
- Always use TLS 1.2 encryption to my service and to dependent services (even datastores)
- Use SSO for users and not hold users locally
- Have a way of providing auditable information on myself
- Have authentication / authorization for dependent services where data needs to be protected
